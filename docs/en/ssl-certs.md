# RealMe module for SilverStripe

## SSL Certificates

Information regarding purchasing and using SSL certificates for RealMe will be documented in this file.

Four certificates must be purchased by the agency - two each for ITE and production environments.

**Note: This is not required if using CWP infrastructure. In CWP, you should
[raise a service desk ticket](https://www.cwp.govt.nz/service-desk/new-request/) to begin this process -
CWP Operations staff will purchase certificates, install them, and invoice you for this service. These
instructions are only necessary when using this module on infrastructure other than CWP.

### Requirements when purchasing & installing certificates

RealMe places some restrictions on which certificate authorities can be used, and also the type of
certificates purchased. Of note, these are:

* SSL Certificates must be purchased from either [RapidSSL](https://www.rapidssl.com/) or
  [VeriSign](https://www.verisign.com/).
* When purchasing certificates, RealMe requires that three-year expiries are purchased and used.
* The certificate bit length must be 2048 (this is generally the default).
* The serial number must be non-negative (the default).
* The common name on the certificates must be as per RealMe instructions for the different
  environments - see the below table.

### Certificate naming requirements

Exact instructions can be found in the Technical Architecture document within the RealMe Shared Workspace.

In the table below, `highlighted` text indicates sections of the common name that would be changed when
purchasing certificates.

| **Certificate Description**                | **Common Name Example**                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| SAML Signing certificate for ITE           | ite.sa.saml.sig.`realme-demo.cwp.govt.nz`    |
| SAML Mutual SSL certificate for ITE        | ite.sa.mutual.ssl.`realme-demo.cwp.govt.nz`  |
| SAML Signing certificate for production    | prod.sa.saml.sig.`realme-demo.cwp.govt.nz`   |
| SAML Mutual SSL certificate for production | prod.sa.mutual.ssl.`realme-demo.cwp.govt.nz` |

### Manually creating certificate requests

Step One: Generate private key files:
Note the domain names in these commands should be replaced with your own.

```bash
openssl genrsa -out ite.sa.saml.sig.realme-demo.cwp.govt.nz.key 2048
openssl genrsa -out ite.sa.mutual.ssl.realme-demo.cwp.got.nz.key 2048
```

Step Two: Create certificate signing requests:
Note the domain names in these commands should be replaced with your own.

```bash
openssl req -new -key ite.sa.saml.sig.realme-demo.cwp.govt.nz.key -out ite.sa.saml.sig.realme-demo.cwp.govt.nz.csr
openssl req -new -key ite.sa.mutual.ssl.realme-demo.cwp.govt.nz.key -out ite.sa.mutual.ssl.realme-demo.cwp.govt.nz.csr
```

When prompted by `openssl`, use the following parameters:

| **Paramater**            | **Value**                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Country Name             | NZ                                     |
| State or Province Name   | Region of Agency, typically Wellington |
| Locality Name            | City name, typically Wellington        |
| Organisation Name        | Legal name of Agency                   |
| Organisational Unit Name | Leave blank                            |
| Common Name              | See above table for examples           |
| Email Address            | Leave blank                            |
| A challenge password     | Leave blank                            |
| An optional company name | Leave blank                            |

### Manually installing certificates

If not running on CWP, then you must manually create the directory that the `REALME_CERT_DIR` environment variable
points to. As well as loading the certificates that have been purchased into this folder, the appropriate public keys
from the RealMe Shared Workspace must be added as well. More information on this process is available within the RealMe
shared workspace.
